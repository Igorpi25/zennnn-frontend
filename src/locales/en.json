    "faqTitle": "FAQ",
    "q1": "What is ZENNNN?",
    "a1": "It is a tool which helps to save time and resources of your company. It helps to optimize the work and makes it look like a game. The employer simply needs to keep track of \"Deals\" section to make sure all of the created deals are getting green(🎾).. This means that all the good are located in the warehouse. Another important marker is a blue light(💙), which signals that the shipment was sent. The presence of both markers means that your work with the deal is finished and now it's receiving party's job. Thus the instructions of your manager or system operator are quite simple. They need to fill in all the necessary fields for goods to become green(🎾)..",
    "q2": "What are the deals and how do they work?",
    "a2": "Deals are a constructor which collects minimum data for international trade. This data is important for logistics companies, clients, customs clearance and preparing documents for the selling goods. The constructor helps to fix the price of purchase and sale of the product. It also helps to set retail margin and conduct operational activities which is necessary for every company. All the goods and services have their cost prices and clients costs. You can sell products of one supplier to your clients as well as of many different suppliers. All of these is possible thanks to functionality of ZENNNN. ",
    "q3": "How do the margin and commission functions work?",
    "a3": "If you are a dealer and your supplier's prices are clear for the client (market).Put the supplier's price in the \"For client column. Put the commission percent from your dealer agreement in the section below.ZENNNN automatically calculates the price of each product which each supplier needs to pay. The profit is also calculated automatically. The margin is necessary if you work with the cost price of goods and set client's price by yourself. Set the margin and invite a client into the personal account with automatically calculated prices including your profit. You can set prices automatically for the whole set of goods as well as individually. For the second option turn off \"All goods\" mode.",
    "q4": "How can ZENNNN help in remote purchasing of goods?",
    "a4": "a) A manufacturer can create its account in ZENNNN and share information about goods with you. You can control all the information in your personal account with this manufacturer. b) You can find a foreign citizen, add them to the structure of the company as a manager. They will collect and record information about goods in their native language which you will see in your language. Thus you will have an opportunity to change financial information, keep track of this employee's activity and control shipment.",
    "q5": "What is a client's personal account?",
    "a5": "Imagine that your commercial proposal or a price list looks like a cart in an online shop. Your clients will be able to track all the main stages of your work and, if needed, comment each product or service. This account can be seen in different languages which allows foreign clients to collaborate with you. ",
    "q6": "What is a product status?",
    "a6": "During the process of purchasing goods, each product may have different statuses. When a product isn't completely described i.e. model, number, price, it is considered to be planned and has Pending status (grey marker). A product with the number and price means that a manager started working with it so it has Processing status (red marker). In most cases if a manager set all the information about a product about the number, prices and cargo characteristics , then this product has \"In production\" status (yellow marker). Finally, a product in stock consequently has \"In stock\" status (green marker). Blue marker means \"sent\" status and is related to the whole set of goods.",
    "q7": "What can a Director do?",
    "a7": "A Director has full access to the functionality without limitations.",
    "q8": "What can employees do?",
    "a8": "Any organization structure has its hierarchy. Access to certain information and functions is set according to the position of a specialist. For example, if you are the owner of the account and you have three legal entities for different needs, so only you have the permissions to edit this information. Employees of the company can't add and edit such important information. This is done so for security reasons and to avoid mistakes during document creation.",
    "q9": "What can warehousemen do?",
    "a9": "Warehousemen can include your own employees as well as third party organization which provides warehouse services. For this role only sections with information about the goods, names, numbers, package and volume are available. The price section is unavailable. It is done so to prevent warehousemen from finding out material value of the cargos they work with. Also warehousemen don't have access to your database of clients, suppliers and goods. They can't create and print documents.",
    "q10": "What can managers do?",
    "a10": "A manager has access to almost everything necessary for working with clients. Managers can't employ people, add legal entities' details, which are used by your company and can't see clients added by other managers. This rule protects your client database from stealing in case an employee is fired. If you need to transfer a client from one manager to another, you just need to enter the full name of the client during creation of a deal. For example, Apple Inc. The clients added by a manager will be shown in the search by the matching letters. For example, when you enter 'ap' you'll see Apple Inc., April Tailor and other matching results.",
    "q11": "What can accountants do?",
    "a11": "ZENNNN accountants like any others control money movement between contractors and record dates based on payment documents. Accountants have access to all current deals, they can fix the dates of pre- and postpayments as well as rates for financial documents. However, editing all the other information is unavailable for them.",
    "q12": "What is automatic compilation of documents?",
    "a12": "ZENNNN isn't only a beautiful interface, all the data entered during the working process will be used as soon as you have a need. Apart from that, ZENNNN understands what languages should documents contain by their type as well as the way data should be formatted for the document to be completed properly. If there is something missing, ZENNNN can help you. You don't need to use Word or Excel for document creating and pay a translator for a version in different language.",
    "q13": "What if I have more employees than the plan I chose includes?",
    "a13": "a) You can choose another plan with bigger number of users, b) we don't limit number of users working with ZENNNN in one account simultaneously. Although doing so can provoke errors due to discrepancies among employees using the same account. Apart from that, system logics made to reduce the number of employees working with sales and logistics to optimize teams by means of extended process automatization. Roles of managers, accountants, warehousemen and directors are enough to cover all of the business processes of every company. Increasing number of managers and warehousemen is necessary as a result of increasing number of clients and cargos.",
    "q14": "What can freelancers do?",
    "a14": "This role has access to the minimum functions. Freelancers can see only the deals they were invited to. They can add extra photos of goods and decription. They can see warehouse information but can't edit it. They also don't see prices. This role is necessary for product inspection when you need to go to a supplier to check availability and quality of the products. As this activity doesn't require a special employee in the company, freelance worker is the best choice. ",
    "q15": "What function does each plan include?",
    "a15": "All the functions except SMS notifications are available in all of the plans. Limitations are connected with the number of employees in the main account of the company.",
    "q16": "If a ZENNNN user shares information with me, who else can see it?",
    "a16": "All the data which can be shared inside the system has its settings: available to one person, available to everyone, unavailable.",
    "q17": "Your system has the same functions as many others. Why should I choose ZENNNN?",
    "a17": "As people use numbers to calculate and letters to write, functionality of computer systems is pretty similar.  The difference is in the efficiency of the tool. The first device used for calculation was wooden abacus, then calculator, then ECM, specialized software and now it's ZENNNN. Joking aside, we are really concerned about the question how we can improve existing tools of conducting accounting and financial management to get rid of numbers in the future."
